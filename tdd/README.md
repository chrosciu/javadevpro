1. Create a simple `StringCalculator` class with a static method `int add(String numbers)`
2. The `add` method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers (separated with commas). For example: `` or `1` or `1,2`
3. For an empty string method should return 0
4. Method should return sum of passed numbers
5. Allow  method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
6. Allow method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas). The following input is ok: `1\n2,3` (will equal `6`)
